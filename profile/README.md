# GT Archive Team

We are a group of ~~nerds~~ nostalgic hobbyists recreating the days of old Gorilla Tag™.

Our main project is [GTPatcher-Launcher](https://github.com/gtarchiveteam/GTPatcher-Launcher) where you can download and patch old builds of Gorilla Tag™, allowing you to go into lobbys and be monkeh on old versions.

Please do note that we are not related to the similarly named project "Gorilla Tag Archive" which illegally redistributes the game.
